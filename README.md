# TrackerPacketQuality
Able to monitor all connected Watchman/Valve VR modules/Tundra dongles on it's incoming packages.<BR>
If your trackers are flying away it might be signal interference and package count will drop. Also I noticed when there's alot of trackers connected, the package count will drop.
Sometimes when you have alot of reflections in your room such as a mirror or glossy screen, packages won't drop but your trackers might behave weirdly, just cover up the shiny things.

    The value's should be equally with many other devices, if one is reporting less packages, there might be some interference problems. You might move the dongle's more further away from eachother.
