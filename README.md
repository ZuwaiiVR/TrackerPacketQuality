# TrackerPacketQuality
Able to monitor all connected Watchman/Valve VR modules/Tundra dongles on it's incomming packages.
If your trackers are flying away it might be signal interference and package count will drop. Also I noticed when there's alot of trackers connected, the package count will drop.
Sometimes when you have alot of reflections in your room such as a mirror or glossy screen, packages won't drop but your trackers might behave weirdly, just cover up the shiny things.
